# Running the program
OBS: When run on mac, MacOS identifies the program as malware. This means it has to be explicity allowed to work. Like this:
1. Run the command as specified below. MacOS will prompt you about the security. Hit OK.
2. Go to System Settins -> Privacy & Security -> Scroll to Security, and hit the "Allow Anyway button"
3. Type in you password.
4. Run the command again. MacOS will prompt you again, but this time hit "Open"

From the root folder, either:
- Type in *make* in the terminal.
- or Type in *dotnet run --project ScrabbleTemplate/ScrabbleTemplate*

The program cannot be executed directly through Rider, it has to be run via the terminal.


# Background
We are trying to get 2 points.
We have a list of anchor points â€“ they are printed in the terminal. 
If we can't build any words starting from these anchor points we will try to swap tiles.
If there are no tiles left from the server and get this information, we pass. This means that we often end with having either no more anchor points 
or having a hand with a few consonants that we cannot use, like 'x' or 'z'.

We have run the program over ten times and we end in these scenarios:
1. We are out of anchor points and tiles, so the game ends
2. We are out of anchor points and have less than 5 tiles left, so we pass 3 times
3. We have less than 7 tiles left, but we cannot build a word because the letters are hard to place consonants, so we pass 3 times
